This is used by the fused halo region update kernels: here every thread has a prescribed dimension it is tasked with updating, but for the edges and vertices, the thread responsible for the entire update is the &quot;greatest&quot; one. Hence some threads may be labelled as a given dimension, but they have to update other dimensions too. Conversely, a given thread may be labeled for a given dimension, but if that thread lies at en edge or vertex, and we have partitioned a higher dimension, then that thread will cede to the higher thread.
