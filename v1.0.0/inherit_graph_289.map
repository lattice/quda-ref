<area shape="rect" id="node1" href="$structquda_1_1gauge__wrapper.html" title="gauge_wrapper is an internal class that is used to wrap instances of gauge accessors, currying in a specific location on the field. The operator() accessors in gauge&#45;field accessors return instances to this class, allowing us to then use operator overloading upon this class to interact with the Matrix class. As a result we can include gauge&#45;field accessors directly in Matrix expressions in kernels without having to declare temporaries with explicit calls to the load/save methods in the gauge&#45;field accessors.
